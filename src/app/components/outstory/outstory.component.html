      <h2>Like a lot of good stories, it started with a pain too</h2>

      <p>
        Just like you, we were a growing organization that needed a people
        platform to scale our services business. We evaluated every software in
        the market and were frustrated.<br />
        Thus started Keka. <br />
        The goal was simple. Automate and simplify people processes, so you can
        focus on your core asset - the employees. They in turn will transform
        you from a good to great organization!

      <p>
        Keka has been a silent revolution in the making from our launch four
        years ago. Our steadfast focus on building an employee centric HR
        platform was well received by more than 3000 businesses across India and
        the world. Today we are Indiaâ€™s #1 platform in the segment with most
        number of new customers adopting the platform. All with zero advertising
        spend and pure customer love.
